# New York City Schools Project
The aim of the project is understanding the relationships between the schools in NYC and the performance of their students as for their SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Tests) scores. Education in America is a controversial topic given the costs for education and the rumours about inequalities, hence some of the questions we will try to investigate cover the following:
- Is there any difference in performance due to gender?
- Are there degrees of ratial inequality?
- Is criminality in some areas affecting SAT scores?
- What of language proficiency (especially for immigrants)? 

Analyzed datasets are open to be downloaded from https://data.cityofnewyork.us
